# Native BIN phase analysis

Developer: Saeed Nik. ArduPlane 4.6.3 native Windows SITL, release 3.0.1.

Firmware SHA-256: `4bfa07c8b3f1febac6045f91058c5eab49b57801fd45eec16702940c54c2fe66`.

The seven requested scenarios were checked in eight independent flights. MANUAL and AUTO capture are separate runs. These flights use standard MAVLink stimuli and native aircraft dynamics; they are not claimed as eight complete mouse-flown QGroundControl trials.

Time is native simulation time from TimeUS, in seconds. Alt is Home-relative height at the RSC decision. Az is gravity-compensated acceleration positive DOWN, in m/s². Vz is sink positive DOWN, in m/s. A parachute row is the supervisor request time; the actuator output follows the configured 0.5 s delay.

## Where each phase is visible

- RSC: supervisor state/event, decision height, acceleration, sink, attitude, airspeed and risk flags.
- MODE: automatic mode capture and pilot handover, including the mode-change reason.
- TECS: the existing controller is active during recovery; this is not a replacement pitch/throttle law.
- RCOU: motor PWM and the parachute release channel.
- ARM: armed/disarmed state around release.

Risk flags may be combined: 1 acceleration, 2 sink, 4 attitude, 8 rotation, 16 time to Home, 32 additional impact-entry guard, 64 verified braking clearance, 128 bounded pull-out response grace. A risk bit alone is not necessarily a capture event.

## Reference five-second decision

In the original no_pilot acceptance flight, capture occurred at 71.924552 s and 99.96 m Home with Az 7.416 m/s². Stable recovery was declared at 101.905055 s and 197.29 m. The no-response request was logged at 106.924713 s, a 5.019658 s interval. The approximately 20 ms difference is one supervisor scheduling step; RSC_HAND_S remains 5 s. Release output, motor cut and disarm are independently checked.

## Disclosed extensions

The acceleration path in the brief remains. The extra steady-descent guard can also capture below 100 m when continuous descent has lasted 1 s with 2 m loss, sink exceeds 5 m/s (or 2 m/s below 30 m), and time to Home is below 6 s for 0.2 s. Verified braking and a once-per-descent response grace can defer only this extra path. Optional fresh deliberate stick/throttle acknowledgment selects FBWA; RSC_STK_EN=0 retains mode-change-only handover.

## Additional recorded video flight

The separate [media-flight/result.json](https://github.com/saeednikakhtar/rescue-flight-lab/blob/main/evidence/media-flight/result.json) is a repeat of scenario 5 on the identical binary, extended to full modeled canopy inflation and model ground contact. Its [original BIN](https://github.com/saeednikakhtar/rescue-flight-lab/blob/main/evidence/media-flight/no-pilot-complete.BIN) is retained. It supports the recorded demonstration and does not increase the count of unique acceptance scenarios.

## Verification limits

Fourteen additional native regressions are recorded in low-height-verification.json and the complete release. A retained controlled-descent approach-timeout attempt was followed by a successful repeat with a longer approach allowance on the same firmware. The full ten-case attended QGC desktop campaign remains incomplete. Home is not measured terrain clearance. No physical-controller or real-parachute qualification is claimed.
