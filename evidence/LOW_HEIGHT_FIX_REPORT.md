# Low-height detection correction

Developer: Saeed Nik. Native SITL only. Firmware SHA-256: `4bfa07c8b3f1febac6045f91058c5eab49b57801fd45eec16702940c54c2fe66`.

## Recorded fault

The original QGC flight reached 30.06 m Home with 7.67 m/s sink and -0.034 m/s² down acceleration. No acceleration-qualified sample occurred below 100 m during that descent. A separate later descent triggered at 77.67 m with 17.86 m/s²; it was a new qualification, not a delayed command. The original BIN snapshot is retained.

## Correction

The brief’s acceleration rule remains. The additional impact path requires confirmed descent (1 s / 2 m loss), height below 100 m Home, time to Home below 6 s, and sink above 5 m/s (or above 2 m/s below 30 m). A 0.2 s continuous dwell applies. Verified braking suppresses this extra path. A once-per-descent, bounded 0.5 s response grace lets a physically responding pilot pull-out establish braking clearance. It cannot veto the original acceleration rule or extend repeatedly.

No new parameters were added. Existing RSC_TTC_S is now 6 s and RSC_MIN_ALT also bounds the low-speed emergency envelope. Risk bits 32, 64 and 128 distinguish impact entry, braking clearance and response grace. TECS, existing attitude control and AP_Parachute still fly/release the aircraft.

This is an explicit extension to the PDF’s acceleration-only entry condition, made to address the requested steady-descent protection. Home is not terrain height. The margin and stopping estimate are native-model heuristics, not certified aircraft performance.

The seven required acceptance scenarios passed in eight separate native flights (MANUAL and AUTO are separate). Native BIN checks cover the original acceleration gate, existing TECS, stable envelope, five-second deadline, pilot handover, release output, motor cut and disarm.

The first final-run controlled-descent attempt hit only the test’s approach timeout before reaching 55 m, without any rescue intervention. The repeated case passed with a 60 s approach allowance. Both recordings remain available.

These 22 flights use direct MAVLink stimuli. They are not described as 22 mouse-flown QGC flights. The separate desktop campaign records real virtual-joystick input and any native mode/altitude preparation commands.

## Desktop QGC trial

Actual QGC input was verified with the temporary left-handed layout: pitch held its value after release. TAKEOFF, GUIDED altitude and source-mode preparation used direct MAVLink commands, and are not claimed as mouse commands. The neutral and gentle-descent intervals had no capture. Controlled descent crossed 100 m and reached the intended 70 m checkpoint without capture. The read-only checkpoint did not stop the held command, and the subsequent unattended approach reached the native ground. The overall desktop trial is not a passed rescue flight, and the requested complete ten-case desktop campaign remains pending. See low-height-review/qgc-desktop-trial.json and the original flight recording. The native 22-case verification is separate.

The checkpoint runner was corrected with an explicit --hold option. A separate native descent switched to LOITER at 79.39 m and subsequently held 78.50 m without RESCUE. This is a test-harness guardrail, not a firmware detector change. Original joystick settings were restored. The final prepared session is `live-20261016-171823-e9eed6bd`, disarmed on the runway, motor PWM 1000, QGC connected.
